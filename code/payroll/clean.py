"""
clean.py — Step 1 of the pipeline: turn text into numbers, one value at a time.

Two element functions that each read one messy string and return one number, and
two DataFrame functions that use `Series.apply` to run them down a whole column
and store the result in a **new** column.

The lineage rule, which every step of this pipeline follows:

    A pipeline function takes a DataFrame and returns a WIDER copy of it.
    It never changes a value it was given, never removes a column, never renames
    one, and never modifies the frame the caller passed in.

So `"38h 30m"` stays in `hours`, and `38.5` goes in `hours_worked` beside it. An
auditor reading the payroll table can see both — which is the point.

This step is walked through line by line in each docstring. The next two steps
give you less.

def parse_hours(value) -> float:
    """Read a weekly-hours string the way a shift lead typed it; return a float.

    Examples:

        parse_hours("38h 30m")   ->  38.5
        parse_hours("42h")       ->  42.0
        parse_hours("45m")       ->  0.75
        parse_hours("24.5")      ->  24.5
        parse_hours("")          ->  0.0      # unreadable -> zero, never a crash
        parse_hours(None)        ->  0.0

    How to build it:

    - Guard first: if `value` is not a string, return `float(value)` if it is a
      number and `0.0` if it is `None`/missing. (`pd.isna(value)` is the test for
      missing.)
    - Strip whitespace. If what is left is empty, return `0.0`.
    - The decimal form has no letters: if `"h"` and `"m"` are both absent, try
      `float(text)`; a `ValueError` means unreadable, so return `0.0`.
    - Otherwise start `hours = 0.0`, then look at each word from `text.split()`:
      a word ending in `"h"` adds `float(word[:-1])`, a word ending in `"m"` adds
      `float(word[:-1]) / 60`. Wrap the arithmetic in `try/except ValueError`
      and return `0.0` if anything inside a word is not a number.
    - The mistake people make: forgetting the `/ 60`. `"45m"` is three quarters
      of an hour, not 45 hours, and `test_parse_hours` will tell you.
