compute.py — Step 3 of the pipeline: pay, labels, and the file the provider wants.

Two element functions that need **two** values from a row, two DataFrame
functions that run them across every row with `DataFrame.apply(..., axis=1)`,
the function that chains all three steps into one call, and the export that
reshapes the result for the online payroll provider.

No walkthrough this time. You have `clean.py` and `join.py` beside you, the
docstrings say what each function must return, and `tests/test_unit.py` and
`tests/test_pipeline.py` say exactly how they will be checked.
